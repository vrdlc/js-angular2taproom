## Description

_This web app is designed to help bar owners keep track of the amount of beer left in their kegs._

## Setup/Installation

#### System Requirements

1. [Node Package Manager (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/)
2. [Angular 2](https://angular.io/)
3. [Bower](http://bower.io/)

#### Installation

* After cloning the repository, run "npm install" and "bower install" in the terminal. This will install every dependency and package off the manifests in the bower.JSON and package.JSON files.
* In the terminal, type "gulp build" followed by "gulp serve". This should open a new browser window with a search field.
* In this app you can add kegs, view how near they are to being emptied, and move them from the "blown" list to the "tapped" list.
